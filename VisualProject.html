                <h2>Reverend Hale, who is a proven witch hunter and religious leader, helped other leaders in the community promote hysteria by "proving that a witch is among us."</h2>
                <p>After “first discovering a witch in Salem” reverend hale is question on whether or not there is actual proof that any of the accused are witches, at that he responds with, "No man may longer doubt the powers of the dark are gathered in monstrous attack upon this village. There is too much evidence now to deny it." (Miller 64) Hale says this to only support his position further by dismissing the argument saying that since one witch was proven to be in the town there could be many other lurking in the shadows.  After Hale has been attacked with so many question that he himself begins to question the proof that there are witches in Salem he further supports his stance by telling himself,  "I am a minister of the Lord, and I dare not take a life without there be a proof so immaculate no slightest qualm of conscience may doubt it." (Miller 99) Hale has to tell himself that he is not being corrupt and spreading false rumors of witchcraft in Salem. Due to Hales behavior, he began promoting a hysterical crowd mindset and allowing for fear to control his decisions.</p>

                <h2>The Court with Hales backing began just accusing whoever they felt like.</h2>
                <p>When Proctor questions the court and its power by saying, “Why do you never wonder if Parris be innocent, or Abigail? Is the accuser always holy now? Were they born this morning as clean as God's fingers? I'll tell you what's walking Salem - vengeance is walking Salem. We are what we always were in Salem, but now the little crazy children are jangling the keys of the kingdom, and common vengeance writes the law! This warrant's vengeance!" (Miller 77) Proctor is wondering, if these people where accused, why should we trust them.  Danforth representing the court states there reasoning the best, “In an ordinary crime, how does one defend the accused? One calls up witnesses to prove his innocence. But witchcraft is ipso facto, on its face and by its nature, an invisible crime, is it not? Therefore, who may possibly be witness to it? The witch and the victim. None other. Now we cannot hope the witch will accuse herself; granted? Therefore, we must rely upon her victims - and they do testify, the children certainly do testify. As for the witches, none will deny that we are most eager for all their confessions. Therefore, what is left for a lawyer to bring out? I think I have made my point. Have I not?" (Miller 100) He says that if this were a normal criminal case, we would call witness up to stand, but this is not a normal criminal case, all the crimes committed here are supernatural and therefor can only be witnessed by the victim and the accused.  They say that we cannot expect the accused to come out and confess their crimes, so we need to really on the good heart of the victim to expose the accused.</p>

                <h2>Abigail Williams used her place as the first accused and confessed witch to claw herself into a place of power.</h2>
                <p>Abigail keeps her power over the other girls by threatening, "And mark this. Let either of you breathe a word, or the edge of a word, about the other things, and I will come to you in the black of some terrible night and I will bring a pointy reckoning that will shudder you. And you know I can do it; I saw Indians smash my dear parents’ heads on the pillow next to mine, and I have seen some reddish work done at night, and I can make you wish you had never seen the sun go down!" (Miller 20) This allows her to keep control of what the other girls say and to who they say it.  This creates a situation where she has control over a majority of the witnesses of the crime of witchcraft and therefor, she has the most power in the town to either prove or disprove anyone guilty of witchcraft.  Abigail shows that she knows how much power she has by openly threatening Judge Danforth, “Let you beware, Mr. Danforth. Think you to be so mighty that the power of Hell may not turn your wits? Beware of it!" (Miller 108) After she has control of the court, she uses it to get revenge on many people who have wronged her.  No one, even the “witches” themselves don’t know who will be accused next.</p>
